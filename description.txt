# Habit Buddies: A Social Habit-Tracking Web Application

## Project Overview

Habit Buddies is a modern, full-stack web application designed to make habit formation engaging, social, and effective. The core principle is that accountability and community are powerful motivators. This app provides a platform for users to join groups, track shared habits, compete in friendly leaderboards, and communicate directly with their "buddies." To enhance the experience, the application leverages generative AI to provide personalized encouragement and playful accountability nudges, acting as a smart, supportive companion on the user's journey to self-improvement.

The application is fully responsive, offering a seamless and intuitive experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

## Key Features
